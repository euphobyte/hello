### Headless Operation

There are good reasons to off-load many tasks from a desktop PC to a personal server.  The less software you install on your desktop 
the lighter your your desktop hardware needs to be (meaning less expensive hardware).  The performance of your hardware is better, 
also when running virus scanners and installing updates. Scans and updates execute faster and are less frequent.  It also good for 
security, because there are fewer possible threats present in the installed software of your desktop.  All of this only applies to 
your desktop computer.
