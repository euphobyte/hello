### Set console font (non GUI)

From the terminal session set the default console font with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
```

Configure:
- Encoding to use: UTF-8
- Character ser: Latin1
- Font for console: Fixed
- Font size: 8x16

*It takes a few seconds, for the characters on the screen to change to the newly selected font*
