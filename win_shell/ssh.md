# SSH Secure Shell

Once ssh is activated.  Communicate with remote server via SSH using the following command:
```
> ssh -t username@10.0.0.1 "cd subdir/source;bash"
```
The remote server will then ask for the users password.  Once the login is completed the user has commandline access to the remote 
server.
